The Enigma Machine is a typewriter-like machine, which uses a set of mechanical Rotors to achieve polyalphabetic substitution to encrypt texts.

EnigmAndroid lays its focus on realistic and authentic encryption, rather than on authentic look and feel. The goal is to have an application that can decrypt historic messages given the correct settings.

Features:

* Growing number of authentic Enigma-Models
* Quickly encrypt any text by sharing it from any other app
* Also quickly share encrypted texts from EnigmAndroid to any other app
